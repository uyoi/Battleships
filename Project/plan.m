Planning

- user chooses vs AI or other player

- randomly assign ships across map for both players

- display player's arrangement with white against black
    - hit ship will be between grey and black

- player begins first

AI option:
- AI randomly shoots at coordinate - state whether hit or not

- players turn

- whoever wins 

player option:

- take turns, show each map after turn

- keep info: moves made by player and opponent

- USE FUNCTION AND INPUT CHANGING USER INPUTS FOR EACH TURN
